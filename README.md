### Python is the best programming language :snake:

Which is why my favorite projects, [Unanimism](https://github.com/benrucker/Unanimism) and [JermaBot](https://github.com/benrucker/JermaBot) are written in it! Feel free to direct any complaints to my [business email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A).

### About me

I'm a comp sci student with tech-industry experience. Always looking for a new challenge. Over 1,500 commits here on my profile. That's not counting the private commits I've made to Pitt's CMPINF0010 repo that I'm an undergrad TA for.

Working on art projects when I'm not programming. My current favorite: music production in Ableton. If you have any favorite resources for learning music, let me know!

Also, here's a picture of my dog :dog:
